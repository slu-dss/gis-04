## Lesson Overview
This repository contains the third lesson for our series on GIS work in `R`. We'll focus on geoprocessing, which is a set of techniques for (a) modifying the geometric data we are working with or (b) using our geometric data as a starting point for modifying our attributes.

### Objectives
At the end of this lesson, participants should be able to:

1. Perform common geoprocessing techniques in `R`, including identifying centroids, intersecting and clipping features, and dissolving features

### Lesson Resources
* The [`notebook/`](/notebook) directory contains the materials for this lesson.

### Extra Resources
* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
* [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net)

## Lesson Quick Start
### Install Software
If you participated in the first session, there is no new software for today. However, the packages we'll need for today can be installed if you have not already done so using:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "here", "knitr",
                   "nngeo", "mapview", "rmarkdown", 
                   "sf", "tigris", "usethis"))
```

### Access Lesson
You can download this lesson to your Desktop easily using `usethis`:

```r
usethis::use_course("https://github.com/slu-dss/gis-04/archive/master.zip")
```

By using `usethis::use_course`, all of the lesson materials will be downloaded to your computer, automatically extracted, and saved to your desktop. You can then open the `.Rproj` file to get started.
